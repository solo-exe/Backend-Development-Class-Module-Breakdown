# Backend-Development-Class-Module-Breakdown
**Tutorial Consoderations:**

*   **Learning Pace:** This is a *fast* pace.  Adjust based on the students' backgrounds and aptitude.
*   **Hands-on Projects:**  Each module *must* include a significant hands-on project that reinforces the concepts learned.  Smaller exercises throughout the module are also critical.
*   **Tools:**  Ensure students have access to appropriate IDEs (VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition), Node.js, Kotlin SDK, and a database (PostgreSQL recommended).
*   **Focus on Fundamentals:** Prioritize understanding over memorization. Explain the *why* behind the *how*.
*   **Version Control (Git):** Introduce Git from day one!  Use a platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
